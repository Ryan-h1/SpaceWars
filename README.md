# SpaceWars
This is a repository for a java-based video game called Space Wars I made in Highschool.

# Requirements
    Java 8/"1.8" or higher.

# How to Run
    A .jar file is provided to run the program called "SpaceWars.jar". If the .jar file
    does not run on your machine, you can compile the code yourself via the source code
    located in the SourceCode folder. Note that you must move the Graphics and Sound
    folders into the SourceCode folder if you look to run a compiled program from within
    the SourceCode folder. Game.java is the main file within the source code of this program.

# A Brief Description
    Upon running, this program displays a 960 x 1280 menu screen to the user, with three
    buttons: Play, Instructions, and Exit, as well as a "Space Wars" title at the top of the
    screen. Pressing the exit button will close the program, the instructions button will
    display the game instructions and controls to the player, and pressing the play button
    will start the game. Please look to the SpaceWarsManual.pdf manual to further 
    familiarize yourself with the game.
